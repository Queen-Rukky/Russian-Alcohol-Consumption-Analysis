# Russian Alcohol Consumption Analysis  

## Overview  
This project analyzes alcohol consumption trends in Russia using historical data. The dataset provides insights into the types of alcoholic beverages consumed, patterns over time, and possible socio-economic impacts. By leveraging data analytics, we aim to uncover meaningful trends and correlations that can inform public health policies and economic decisions.  

## Objectives  
- **Identify Trends**: Understand how alcohol consumption has changed over time in Russia.  
- **Beverage Breakdown**: Analyze the consumption of different types of alcohol, such as vodka, beer, and wine.  
- **Public Health Insights**: Explore potential links between alcohol consumption and health issues.  
- **Economic Implications**: Assess the impact of alcohol consumption on the economy and government policies.  

## Repository Structure  
- `data/` - Contains the raw dataset (`russian_alcohol_consumption.xlsx`).  
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and statistical insights.  
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for data processing and visualization.  
- `README.md` - Documentation and project guidelines.  

## Dataset Information  
**File Name:** `russian_alcohol_consumption.xlsx`  
**Format:** Excel (.xlsx)  
**Contents:**  
- Annual alcohol consumption statistics  
- Breakdown by beverage type (vodka, beer, wine, etc.)  
- Possible regional or demographic data (if available)  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.  
   - Convert data into a structured format for analysis.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Generate descriptive statistics.  
   - Create visualizations to identify trends and anomalies.  

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create time series plots, bar charts, and heatmaps.  

4. **Statistical Analysis & Insights**  
   - Identify correlations between alcohol consumption and external factors (e.g., economic downturns, policy changes).  
   - Compare consumption across different beverage categories.  

## Usage  
### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python (>=3.7)  
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data analysis)  
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive analysis)  

### Quick Start  
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Russian-Alcohol-Consumption-Analysis


2. **Load the Data in python**

    import pandas as pd
   
df = pd.read_excel("data/russian_alcohol_consumption.xlsx")

print(df.head())
