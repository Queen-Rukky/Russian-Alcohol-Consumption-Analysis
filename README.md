# Russian Alcohol Consumption Analysis  

## Summary  
Alcohol consumption is a significant aspect of Russian culture and has been a subject of public health and economic studies for decades. This project aims to analyze historical alcohol consumption trends in Russia, providing insights into the types of alcoholic beverages consumed, changes over time, and potential socio-economic and public health impacts.  

By examining this dataset, we can better understand **how alcohol consumption patterns have evolved**, identify factors influencing these changes, and explore possible correlations with economic policies, public health crises, and government regulations. The analysis can also provide meaningful insights into consumer preferences, shifts in drinking habits, and the effectiveness of government interventions, such as taxation and restrictions on alcohol sales.  

The dataset contains detailed records of **alcohol consumption per capita**, categorized by different beverage types such as vodka, beer, wine, and other spirits. The data spans multiple years, making it possible to perform **trend analysis, seasonality detection, and statistical comparisons** between different time periods.  

### Key Areas of Analysis:  
- **Consumption Trends Over Time**: Identifying how alcohol consumption rates have increased or decreased in response to economic conditions, cultural shifts, or government policies.  
- **Beverage Preferences**: Analyzing which types of alcohol are most consumed and how preferences have changed over the years.  
- **Public Health Correlations**: Investigating the potential links between high alcohol consumption and public health issues such as alcoholism, liver disease, and mortality rates.  
- **Economic and Policy Impact**: Assessing how government regulations, taxation, and economic downturns influence alcohol consumption patterns.  
- **Demographic and Regional Trends** *(if applicable)*: Exploring whether certain regions or age groups in Russia consume more alcohol than others.  

The goal of this project is to generate **data-driven insights** that can be used by policymakers, public health officials, and researchers to make informed decisions regarding alcohol regulation, taxation, and awareness programs. This work can also be valuable to economists studying the effects of alcohol production and consumption on the Russian economy.  

## Overview
